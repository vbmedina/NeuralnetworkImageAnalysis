# Summary
Our goal is to train a range of historically important CNN models and use them to classify different facial expressions of manga characters. The characters drawn in this artstyle tend to have exaggerated expressions, which should make the task relatively simple. We our limited by our small dataset, however. We will use data augmentation to help deal with this limitation. 

# Models

# Dataset
We used a [Manga Facial Expressions Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.notion.so/Manga-Facial-Expression-Classification-7fdd265979a742788b903bba312c8c4b) for the training and testing datasets. We manually collected 10 of each class for the remaining validation set. There may be some distributional shift due to differences in our data collection and our definitions of the classes, which should be noted when observing the results.
